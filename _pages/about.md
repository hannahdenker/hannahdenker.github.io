Welcome! My name is Hannah Denker. 

I am a Ph.D candidate in the School of Education at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research focuses on early childhood education policy. I use quantitative methods to understand what makes early childhood experiences beneficial to young children. Exploring this topic, I work with school districts in Colorado and Massachusetts, in addition to the Maryland State Departments of Education. I also explore how classroom assessment can be more equitable as a research associate at Lyons Assessment Consulting.  

Before starting graduate school, I earned a B.S. and a M.S. in Education from Oklahoma State University and was an elementary teacher for four years in the Wichita Public School District. 

I will be on the 2022-23 job market.

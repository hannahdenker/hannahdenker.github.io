Welcome! My name is Hannah Denker. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate with EdPolicyWorks, a collaboration between the School of Education and Human Development, and the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on early childhood education policy. I use quantitative methods to understand what makes early childhood experiences beneficial to young children. Exploring this topic, I work with school districts in Colorado and Massachusetts, in addition to the Virginia and Maryland State Departments of Education. I also explore how classroom assessment can be more equitable as a research associate at Lyons Assessment Consulting.  

Before receiving my Ph.D. from the University of Colorado Boulder, I earned a B.S. and a M.S. in Education from Oklahoma State University and was an elementary teacher for four years in the Wichita Public School District.

Hello! I am a Ph.D candidate in the School of Education at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research focuses on early childhood education policy. My Ph.D is in Research and Evaluation Methodology and my B.S. is in Elementary Education from Oklahoma State University. 

Before starting graduate school, I was an elementary teacher for four years in the Wichita Public School District.

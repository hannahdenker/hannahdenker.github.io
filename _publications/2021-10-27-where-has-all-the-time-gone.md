excerpt: 'High-quality, early childhood education (ECE) experiences can improve children’s learning trajectories and produce long-term social returns. Yet, there is also evidence that ECE effects are variable and do not always persist. There is therefore a need to deepen the research base on what constitutes a ‘high quality’ ECE experience. This need exists on at least two levels—first, to identify which structural features reliably deliver effects, and second to capture the in-classroom processes those structures make possible. This paper provides a case study using an intensive in-classroom data collection effort—a total of 114 all-day class observations with every minute coded for content area(s) and activity type, and up to 14 repeated observations per teacher over a two-year period. In this instance, the data allow us to gain important insights into how teachers leverage time differently when one structural feature of preschool programming—length of the preschool day—changes.'

High-quality, early childhood education (ECE) experiences can improve children’s learning trajectories and produce long-term social returns. Yet, there is also evidence that ECE effects are variable and do not always persist. There is therefore a need to deepen the research base on what constitutes a ‘high quality’ ECE experience. This need exists on at least two levels—first, to identify which structural features reliably deliver effects, and second to capture the in-classroom processes those structures make possible. This paper provides a case study using an intensive in-classroom data collection effort—a total of 114 all-day class observations with every minute coded for content area(s) and activity type, and up to 14 repeated observations per teacher over a two-year period. In this instance, the data allow us to gain important insights into how teachers leverage time differently when one structural feature of preschool programming—length of the preschool day—changes.

* Teaching assistant for Psych 3111 Psychological Science 2: Research Methods in Psychology. This course includes undergraduate students majoring in psychology. I taught weekly lab where we walked through designing and conducting a student-led research project. The course culminated in students writing a research paper about their project and presenting a slidedeck for their projects at the end of the semester. I worked directly with about 30 students during lab, held weekly office hours, and provided feedback on assignments.
